Questions to ask - 

Do we need to do runtime analysis for anything other than our recursive add algorithm ? 

Giving T(n) function or do we need to break down each line? 

What do you mean by the runtime analysis being expressed by the values of "myBigIntegers" ? are we doing it based on the nodes? How else can we do it? 

Run through and make sure we would get full credit
