Questions to ask - 

- Do we need to do runtime analysis for anything other than our recursive add algorithm ?
we need to do a runtime analysis for every method (toString and equals) and they need to be based on the size of the input.

- Giving T(n) function or do we need to break down each line? 
No, just give an intuitive explanation for what the runtime should be.

- What do you mean by the runtime analysis being expressed by the values of "myBigIntegers" ? are we doing it based on the nodes? How else can we do it? 
Figure out the relation between the size (magnitude) of the number MyBigInteger represents and the number of nodes it takes to store that number. That is what the runtime analysis is supposed to be based on.

- Do we need to add psudeocode for equals and toString methods? 
Yes, we need to add psudeocode for every method we use

Run through and make sure we would get full credit
Our code looks good and doesn't need to be modified.
